# Database_project
Creation of connection to our database of repetitions in texts which was made as a part of the final project for Database subject (NRU HSE) in collaboration with [Kirill Milintsevich](https://github.com/501Good). Repetition is defined as 2 or more words having the same stem within a sentence. More info about the database structure can be found at IDEF1_MILINTSEVICH_SADOV_5.pdf.

repetition_db.sql is the database itself.

sentences.txt is a little text collection which served as a source for our database.

stemming.py is a script which prepared data for loading into our database.

connecting_serious.py is a final script for loading additional data into already existing database.
